# The Graph : 

Graph are like google for blockchains 
They store the data in well defined manner such as databases in web2
They Have indexers so that they retrive this data very quickly than other frameworks
If we want same solution like graph in centralized system then we can think of Datasx

### Graphs stroage works on events in solidity when ever an event in smart contract triggers particular subgraph associated with it becomes active and stores data inside that subgraph and Events in Solidity Smart Contract Triggeres Graph Storage 

#### SubGrpah Creation Process:
- npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
- graph init --studio subgraphName
- choose chain 
- Give contract address
- Give abi 
- Give start block from block explorer
- You are good to go 
- graph auth --studio GraphStudiokey
- graph codegen 
- graph build
- graph deploy --studio YoursubgrphName 
- Ypu are good to Go
